<p>The News Beat publishes four different types of articles: news, analysis, opinion, and sponsored content. Please see below to learn more about the types of articles you’ve been reading on our site.</p>

<h4>News</h4>
<p>A news report is based on facts, either observed and verified by the author or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. This includes perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue, distinguishing news reports from public relations or propaganda. News reports do not incorporate the opinion of the author.</p>

<h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>News analysis incorporates additional information, facts, and data that experts indicate provide useful and important context to the original event. A news analysis is based on factual reporting, adhering to the general guidelines for news reports. It generally follows a news report on the same subject.</p>

<h4>Opinion</h4>
<p>Opinion pieces advocate for ideas and draw conclusions based on the author’s interpretation of facts and data.  Opinion pieces are sparked by events in the news and are the author’s analysis, focusing on the author’s own thoughts, personal preferences and conclusions.</p>

<h4>Sponsored Content</h4>
<p>Sponsored content is produced on behalf of, at the behest of, or by an individual or organization that has paid the news provider for its placement. It does not meet the standards of impartial journalism. It should be clearly labeled and presented as sponsored or paid.</p>
