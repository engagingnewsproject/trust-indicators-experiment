$article = '<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; Where do you draw the line between inspiration and imitation when it comes to food?</p>
<p>A few years ago, we brought you the story of Caitlin Freeman, a pastry chef baking innovative, art-inspired cakes at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Using modern art as her muse, Freeman translated what she saw in the museum into edible form at the SFMOMA&rsquo;s upstairs café.'.footnote(1,$footnotes).'</p>
<p>Her creations eventually filled a cookbook, Modern Art Desserts, and her most well-known dish, a cake composed of small, primary-colored blocks delicately cemented together with chocolate icing, graced its cover. Inspired by the geometric art of Piet Mondrian, it brought both Freeman and the café fame – and inspired many a home cook to tackle this masterpiece at home.</p>
<p>The museum closed for renovations in 2013. When it re-opened last month, the upstairs café was under new management, with a new baking team – but the art-themed desserts for sale looked suspiciously familiar to Freeman. Call it a case of copycake.</p>
<p>Blue Bottle, the coffeehouse chain owned by Freeman&rsquo;s husband, James Freeman, used to run the SFMOMA&rsquo;s upstairs café, but it failed to win its bid to return after the renovations. Freeman was disappointed, but, as a lifelong art lover, she nonetheless felt compelled to take her infant daughter to check out the refurbished museum. She even stopped for a few moments to take in the scene at the new café, now run by a catering company that had previously operated the museum&rsquo;s downstairs café.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when three &ldquo;art-inspired&rdquo; desserts the café was serving caught her eye.</p><p>The dishes were strikingly similar in both spirit and design to desserts that Freeman and her team created several years ago for a museum event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stings because I felt like I was doing something for beauty and for love,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just so bummed that the SFMOMA didn&rsquo;t want me and my future inspiration back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the museum says art as a muse for food is not a concept that belongs to Freeman. Neither the SFMOMA nor the new caterer responded to interview requests, but, in a statement, the museum said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SFMOMA is highly respectful of the expression of our partners and their desire to draw inspiration from the museum&rsquo;s architecture and art collection to create new work across all media, including food. Our art-inspired desserts continue a long tradition of art-inspired food served at SFMOMA and at museums and cultural institutions all over the world. We were pleased that Caitlin Freeman was a part of that legacy and are very grateful and respectful of her contributions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the art world as in the food world, creators are constantly finding inspiration in — and riffing off — each other&rsquo;s work. But food is a difficult medium to copyright, so some chefs give credit on the menu if a dish was inspired by another chef.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recipes are not copyrightable, nor are methods of cooking, and ideas are never copyrightable. So the idea of making desserts inspired by artworks could not be copyrighted,&rdquo; says intellectual property attorney Naomi Beckman-Straus with the firm Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp in Los Angeles.'.footnote(2,$footnotes).'</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, there is no clear reason why the visual appearance of a dish could not be copyrighted,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Because our legal system works on precedent, a lot of it is just that it&rsquo;s generally accepted that there&rsquo;s no copyright protection for restaurant dishes or food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Freeman, she says she doesn&rsquo;t plan to pursue legal action.</p>
<p>Complicating all of this is the fact that Corey Lee, the three-Michelin-star chef, is opening a restaurant basically dedicated to cooking the dishes popular at other restaurants while citing them and giving them credit. Of that spot, which has yet to open, he says he&rsquo;s &ldquo;thinking of it as a food exhibition.&rdquo; Since Freeman hasn&rsquo;t gotten SFMOMA to budge, at least yet, maybe she ought to talk to Lee about getting her name on his dessert menu.</p>';
